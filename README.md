# What is keyword Driven Testing

A keyword-driven testing is a scripting technique that uses data files (i.e. Data Engine) to contain the keywords related to the application being tested. These keywords describe the set of actions that is required to perform a specific step.

A keyword-driven test consists of high and low-level keywords, including the keyword arguments, which is composed to describe the action of a test case. Moreover java test scripts are written for all the action keyword in *ActionKeword.java* file.

In Keyword Driven Testing, you first identify a set of keywords and then associate an action (or function) related to these keywords.
